# MacroTech-Website
Interned at a Software and Hardware high-vacuum solutions company where I, acted as a Programming Assistant (C++), but I was also given the opportunity to fully rebuild their website from scratch. To build the website I implemented HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery, and PHP. There is also a mobile version developed using jQuery mobile, which can be accessed using the same link. I have chosen note to add the source files since it exceeds the github limit, they can been seen however using your browser on the website. 

The website can be viewed at: http://www.macrotech.de

I am the sole author of the website, and I continue to update it on a weekly basis.
