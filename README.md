# MacroTech-Website
Interned at a Software and Hardware high-vacuum solutions company where I, acted as a Programming Assistant (C++), but I was also given the opportunity to full rebuild their website from scratch. To build the website I implemented HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery, and PHP. 

The website can be viewed at: http://www.macrotech.de
