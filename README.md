# MacroTech-Website
Interned at a Software and Hardware high-vacuum solutions company where I, acted as a Programming Assistant (C++), but I was also given the opportunity to fully rebuild their website from scratch. To build the website I implemented HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery, and PHP. There is also a mobile version developed using jQuery mobile, which can be accessed using the same link. 

The website can be viewed at: http://www.macrotech.de

I am the sole author of the website, and I continue to update it on a monthly basis.
